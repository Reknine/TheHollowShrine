**Estimated Total Game Duration:** 30-45 minutes  

---

## Game Structure Overview

### 1. Opening: Introduction & World Setup (5 minutes)

- **Player Awakening**: The game opens with the player character awakening near an ancient, forgotten shrine. There's no lengthy exposition; instead, environmental cues like statues, overgrown paths, and eerie music set the mood.
  
- **Basic Mechanics Tutorial**: Early on, there is a subtle tutorial introducing the core mechanics: movement, camera controls, light and heavy attacks, stamina management, and dodge rolling. This can be done through interactable objects or symbols glowing on the ground, following the Souls-like tradition of non-intrusive tutorials.

- **Goal Introduction**: As the player moves forward, they encounter a large gate that is sealed. The objective becomes clear: unlock the gate to face the challenge inside (the boss). The gate is tied to interacting with three ancient obelisks scattered around the shrine area.

### 2. Exploration & Environmental Challenges (10-15 minutes)

- **The Shrine Grounds**: The player is free to explore the relatively small but detailed environment surrounding the shrine. The space is a mix of narrow paths, eerie ruins, and overgrown forest areas, all centered around the main shrine.

- **Mystery and Lore**:
  - Scattered notes or symbols are left for the player to find, hinting at the backstory of the shrine and its boss.
  - Mysterious statues or broken artifacts can be interacted with, offering cryptic lines about the boss and the shrine's purpose.
  - Small environmental details, like forgotten weapons or bones, reinforce the mystery.

- **Environmental Hazards**:
  - **Traps**: Basic traps such as pressure plates that shoot arrows or collapsing floors keep the player on edge.
  - **Minor Enemies**: To avoid overwhelming the player, there are only 2-3 different types of minor enemies scattered throughout the shrine area. These enemies are slow but can be deadly if not handled with precision. They provide practice for dodging and timing attacks, crucial for the boss fight.

- **Unlocking the Gate**: The main objective during this phase is to find and interact with three ancient obelisks around the environment. These obelisks are tied to the lore and power of the shrine, and each unlocks part of the seal on the main gate. Each obelisk may be guarded by a minor environmental challenge (e.g., a trap or a minor enemy).

### 3. Final Preparation & Gate Unlocking (5 minutes)

- **Return to the Shrine**: After activating the three obelisks, the gate to the central shrine opens. The player can now enter, but it’s a good moment to allow for a final preparation phase.
  
  - A checkpoint or resting spot (similar to bonfires in Souls games) is placed just before the boss room. Resting here refills health, but respawns minor enemies.
  - The player can collect or purchase a few healing items or buffs (if you're using such mechanics) scattered or earned during exploration.

- **The Boss Room Entrance**: The player steps through a foreboding, massive door into the central shrine area.

### 4. Final Boss Battle: The Guardian of the Forgotten Shrine (10-15 minutes)

- **Introduction to the Boss**: Upon entering the shrine, the boss stands dormant in the center of a dark, fog-filled chamber. The moment the player approaches, the boss awakens in a dramatic cutscene, showcasing its intimidating design and size (think giant knight or ancient spirit warrior).

- **Phase 1: Boss Introduction (3-5 minutes)**
  - **Combat Basics**: The boss is slow but powerful in this phase. It relies on sweeping melee attacks with a massive weapon (such as a spear or sword), giving the player time to learn its attack patterns.
  - **Telegraphed Moves**: The boss’s attacks are heavily telegraphed, teaching the player when to dodge or block. The player needs to focus on avoiding big, heavy attacks, preserving stamina, and waiting for windows to strike back.

- **Phase 2: Increased Aggression & New Attacks (3-5 minutes)**
  - When the boss reaches 50% health, the battle intensity increases. The boss gains new moves, such as:
    - **Area of Effect (AoE) Attack**: A magic pulse or ground slam that covers a wide area, forcing the player to roll away at the right moment.
    - **Combo Chains**: The boss performs multi-hit combos, making it harder for the player to dodge all hits.
    - **Movement Speed Increase**: The boss moves faster, closing the gap between itself and the player more frequently, creating tension.
  
  - **Environmental Hazards in the Room**: At this stage, part of the shrine may collapse or environmental hazards could activate, like falling debris or pillars that can be used for temporary cover. This keeps the battle dynamic and prevents it from feeling too static.

- **Phase 3: Final Stand (2-3 minutes)**
  - At 20% health, the boss enters a final, desperate phase. It uses faster, more aggressive attacks, and may even summon an additional small hazard (such as spectral swords that float and attack).
  - The music intensifies, and visual effects like fog or magical energy can envelop the boss to signal the final stage.
  - The player needs to remain calm, using all the skills learned so far—dodge rolling, stamina management, and precise timing—to land the final blows.

- **Victory**: After a grueling fight, the player lands the final hit, and the boss collapses in a cinematic fashion. A brief cutscene follows, where the shrine reacts to the boss's defeat—perhaps glowing with new life or crumbling to dust.

### 5. Conclusion & Post-Boss Experience (5 minutes)

- **Ending Cinematic**: After the boss is defeated, the player explores a small final area behind the boss room. Here, they may find a relic or artifact that provides a cryptic conclusion to the story.
  - This could hint at a larger mystery or world, leaving the door open for a sequel or deeper lore.

- **Completion and Replay**: A final checkpoint allows the player to reflect on the experience. If you're interested, you could add New Game+ features, making the game replayable with tougher enemy variations or different challenges in future playthroughs.
